# Application Store (Application Library)
Application store is a crowdsourced marketplace to curate all blockchain-based applications. It allows
seekers to browse for ideas that suit their businesses and purchase ready-to-use or customised
products; it also allows contributors to promote their applications.

The Application Library is initially implemented using OutSystems which generate underlying runtime codes. Now we have decided to use our platform Dashboard framework to reimplement the Application Library. The main framework used by the Dashboard is based on Angular 4. In additition, MySQL and Spring Boot will be used for the backend implementation for the Application Library. The Application Publish, Subscription, Token Transfer, Proof of Reputation will be implemented using a smart contract on Ethereum.

The Application Library will be interfacing with My Repository and Payment modules which will be implemented using separate smart contracts on Ethereum.

The Application Library implementation will follow the overall Morpheus Labs BPaaS architecture principles - open standards, micro service based.

The source codes are in Morpheus Labs own private repository and not open to public. Morpheus lab will determine if this module will be open sourced in future.

For public's interest, Morpheus Labs will share the snippet of the source codes in this Public repository when necessary.
